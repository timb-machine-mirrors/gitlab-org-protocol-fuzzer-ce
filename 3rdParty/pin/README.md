### Please add Intel Pin here!

To build the coverage tools used by MinSet a [copy of Intel Pin](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads.html) is needed for the architecture your building for. The expected version is v3.2 81205.

When extracted we expect the following folders:

- pin-3.2-81205-clang-mac
- pin-3.2-81205-msvs-windows
- pin-3.2-81205-gcc-linux

Newer versions may also work. YMMV.
