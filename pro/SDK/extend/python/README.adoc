= Extending Peach in Python

Normally Peach extensions are written using the Microsoft .NET languages such as C# or VB.NET. However, it is also possible to 
write Peach extensions using just Python with the help of a special IronPython library _clrtype_.

In this folder are several example extensions written in Python. They can be used as the basis for developing your own extensions. Each example extension is contained in a single python source file with an accompaning Peach Pit. All of the extensions require the _clrtype.py_ file. This file contains the special code needed to make the extensions visable to Peach.

To learn more about _clrtype_ you can read the indepth blog articles written by the author:
