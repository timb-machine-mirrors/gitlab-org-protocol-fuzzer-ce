:Description: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6)

 * Peach Pit: DHCPv6
 * Direction: Client
 * Supported Platforms: Windows, Linux, OS X

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Version 6 (DHCPv6) is a variation of the DHCPv4 protocol for the IPv6 address space.

* Like DHCPv4, DHCPv6 allocates addresses from a central server and requests are broadcast across the link layer.
* Unlike IPv4, hosts on an IPv6 network can automatically assign address without DHCP or a central server with stateless address auto-configuration.

Hosts may still use DHCPv6 even if they are not requesting an address to configure other network parameters (like DNS settings).
