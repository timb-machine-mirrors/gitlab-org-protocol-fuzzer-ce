Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the Layer 3 Backbone of the internet.  It is built on top of Ethernet and offers configurable addressing and routing capabilities to computer networks. 
IPv4 is an inherently unreliable protocol because packets may not reach their destination.  Layer 4 protocols like TCP are designed to provide reliable and ordered transmission of data over an IP network.
