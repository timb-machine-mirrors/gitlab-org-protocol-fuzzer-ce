TypeScript files (*.ts) are checked in under app\ts.

When the project is built, the TypeScript files are translated to JavaScript and 
placed in app\js, though are not checked in.

To maintain project dependencies, npm and bower are used.

To get started, install npm from:
http://nodejs.org/

Then run the following commands from this directory:

```
mkdir %HOME%\AppData\Roaming\npm
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower
bower install
```

I usually have two terminals open at all times running these commands:

This one is for unit test.

```
grunt test
```

This one generates the production code and hosts a proxy server. 
It should automatically launch your web browser.
Before launching this command, make sure the Peach server is running first 
(I usually use Ctrl-F5 in Visual Studio for this).

```
grunt
```

Example for looking for package updates:

```
bower ls
```

To add a new package (in this case `angular`):

```
bower install angular -S
tsd query angular -rosa install
grunt init
```
