TypeScript files (*.ts) are checked in under app\ts.

When the project is built, the TypeScript files are translated to JavaScript and 
placed in app\js, though are not checked in.

To maintain project dependencies, npm and bower are used.

Example for looking for package updates:

```
bower ls
```

To add a new package (in this case `angular`):

```
bower install angular -S
tsd query angular -rosa install
```


```
