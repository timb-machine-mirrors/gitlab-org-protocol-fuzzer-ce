TypeScript files (*.ts) are checked in under app\ts.

When the project is built, the TypeScript files are translated to JavaScript and 
placed in app\js, though are not checked in.

To maintain project dependencies, npm and bower are used. You'll need to run `dev.cmd`
to have `bower` and `tsd` in your PATH.

Example for looking for package updates:

```
dev.cmd
bower ls
```

To add a new package (in this case `angular`):

```
dev.cmd
bower install angular -S
tsd query angular -rosa install
```
