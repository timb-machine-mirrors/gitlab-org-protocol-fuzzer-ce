<!-- RAB 12/17/14. When all of the sections of the configuration are complete, 
        you can validate the fuzzing definition for correctness. 

        This section performs a test that runs a single iteration of the Pit, 
        outputs the results of the test, and issues log messages as appropriate.
        You can fine tune a configuration or address any problems that arise with
        a configuration by re-visiting the appropriate section of the configuration, 
        adjusting the settings that you want to edit, and re-run the test. 
-->        
        
		Once all of the configuration sections have been completed you
		can test your definition to verify it works correctly.
		This section will allow you to do just that, running a single iteration of the Pit,
		viewing the output of the test and the detailed log messages.
		If there is a problem with the configuration you can redo the configuration until it is correct.
