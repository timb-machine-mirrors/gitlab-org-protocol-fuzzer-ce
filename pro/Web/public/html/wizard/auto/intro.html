		The Pit Automation section allows you to set up actions that Peach will perform 
		during fuzzing iterations to automate the test environment.
	</p>

	<p>Some sample automation actions include the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Control the electrical power to a device</li>
		<li>Start or stop processes</li>
		<li>Run commands locally or remotely via SSH</li>
		<li>Click buttons, or simulate plugging and unplugging cables</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The Pit Automation section is optional. 
		Skip this section if you don't have the appropriate hardware or
		you choose not to to automate any processes.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you want to automate more than one action, you will need to repeat 
		the Pit Automation section process for each action you want to automate.
	</p>

	<p>

	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>

			(hostname or IP address) of the remote machine
		</li>
