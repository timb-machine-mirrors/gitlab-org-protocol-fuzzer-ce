<!-- RAB 12/17/14.
	<p>The Automation section allows you to set up actions that Peach will perform during fuzzing iterations to automate the test environment.</p>

	<p>Some sample automation actions include the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Control the electrical power to a device</li>
		<li>Start or stop processes</li>
		<li>Run commands locally or remotely via SSH</li>
		<li>Click buttons, or simulate plugging and unplugging cables</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Pit Automation section is optional. </p>

    <p>Skip this section if you don't have the appropriate hardware or 
                you choose not to to automate any processes.</p>

    <p> Fill out this section if you want to automate any of the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Start or stop processes</li>
		<li>Run commands locally or remotely via SSH</li>
		<li>Click buttons</li>
        <li>Simulate plugging and unplugging cables</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you want to automate more than one action, you will need to repeat the Pit Automation section process for each action you want to automate.</p>

	<p>The Pit Automation section requires the following information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Where the automated task runs: on a local machine or on a remote machine</li>
		<li>If the automation is on a remote machine, the operating system and the name (hostname or IP name) of the remotate machine</li>
		<li>The to automate (such as the CanaKit Relay board or a process running on the selected machine)</li>
		<li>Serial port, and related relay information (CanaKit Relay)</li>
		<li>Executable name and location, arguments and actions to take (process)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The Automation section allows you to configure actions that Peach will take during fuzzing iterations to automate the test environment.</p>

	<p>This can include such things as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Control power to a hardware device</li>
		<li>Start or stop processes</li>
		<li>Run commands locally or remotely via SSH</li>

	<p>The Pit Automation section is optional. If you don't have the appropriate hardware or don't want to initiate a process while fuzzing, you may skip this section.</p>

	<p>If you want to automate more than one action, you will need to repeat Pit Automation section process for each action.</p>

	<p>You'll need the following information to complete the Pit Automation section:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Whether you want to automate the task on a local machine or remote machine</li>
		<li>If the automation is done on a remote machine, the remote machine's hostname/IP name and OS</li>
		<li>Which process do you want to automate (CanaKit Relay board or process running on the selected machine)</li>
		<li>Serial port, and related relay information (CanaKit Relay)</li>
		<li>Executable name and location, arguments and actions to take (process)</li>
	</ul>
