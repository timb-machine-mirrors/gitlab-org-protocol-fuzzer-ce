		The Pit Set Variables wizard guides you through those settings required
		to run the Pit. The settings are specific to the selected Pit, as the
		setup information for each pit can vary.
		For some settings, the wizard offers guidance on how to locate the needed
		information.

		For example, network-related Pits typically need network addresses such as the
		IP address or the MAC address of the target.

		The configuration settings for each Pit are described in the Pit Library
		Documentation. This document is included in the Pits zip archive. The
		Pit_Library.pdf file resides in the Pit Library directory.
