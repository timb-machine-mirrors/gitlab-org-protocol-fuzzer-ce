	<p>
		Peach monitors the test target while fuzzing to detect unknown or 
        undesireable  behaviors called faults. For example, a fault would 
        be a program crash. Another fault could be a remote device that 
        becomes unavailable.
	</p>
	<p>
		This portion of the wizard sets up the Pit to define fault detection 
        that is appropriate for the target you are fuzzing.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Pit Fault Detection section requires the following information:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Where to to perform fault detection: on the local machine or on a 
            remote machine.</li>
		<li>If fault detection is remote, what are operating system and the 
            name (hostname or IP name) of the remote machine?</li>
		<li>
			If a process or a service is being tested and monitored for 
            faults, the wizard will request information about starting the 
            process or service.
		</li>
	</ul>

		Peach monitors your target while fuzzing to detect faults
		(checking for irregular behavior such as a program crashing or remote device availability).
	</p>
	<p>
		This portion of the wizard will set up the Pit to perform fault detection
		of the target you are fuzzing.
	</p>
	<p>
		You'll need the following information to complete the Pit Fault Detection section:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Whether you want to perform fault detection on the local machine or a remote machine.</li>
		<li>If the detection is done on a remote machine, the remote machine's hostname/IP name and OS</li>
		<li>
			If performing fault detection on a process,
			information will be asked about starting the process or service
		</li>
