		When Peach Fuzzer Professional(R) detects a fault, the fuzzer can collect 
        and store additional information that can assist in performing root cause 
        analysis of the fault. The logged information can include the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Log files stored on disk or on remote machines via SSH</li>
		<li>Network traffic captures that can be loaded into Wireshark</li>
		<li>Serial console output from devices such as routers or switches</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The Pit Data Collection section is optional.
        <ul>
            <li>Skip this section if you don't produce this kind of data or 
                you choose not to capture the data.</li>
            <li>Configure this section once for a single file.</li>
            <li>Configure this section with multiple entries, once for each item you 
                want to collect.</li>
        </ul>
	</p>


	<p>The Pit Fault Detection section requires the following information:</p>

			If the detection is done on a remote machine,
			operating system and name (hostname or IP name) of the remote
            machine</li>

            locally-generated file, or remote file)</li>
		<li>network device implement (network capture)</li>
