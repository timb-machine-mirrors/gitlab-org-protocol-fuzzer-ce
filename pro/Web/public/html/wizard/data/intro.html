		When Peach Fuzzer detects a fault, the fuzzer can collect
		and store additional information that can assist in performing root cause
		analysis of the fault. The logged information can include the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Log files stored on disk or on remote machines via SSH</li>
		<li>Network traffic captures that can be loaded into Wireshark</li>
		<li>Serial console output from devices such as routers or switches</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The Pit Data Collection section is optional.
		Skip this section if this kind of data is not produced or
		you choose not to capture the data.
