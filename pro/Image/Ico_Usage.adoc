=== Configuration

==== Target Configuration
Any number of image viewing programs may be targeted with the Ico file format. Example targets for fuzzing Ico are "feh" on Linux and "mspaint.exe" on Windows.

In the Ico.xml.config pit file, you can set the target program that you are fuzzing, such as feh or mspaint.exe. Normally you would set different target programs for different operating systems.

==== Required Pit Configuration Changes
Seed:: Name of a valid Ico file located in the Samples directory. An empty string indicates use all files in the directory.  Multiple files can be globbed together with an asterisk wildcard.
Target:: The program that will open the fuzzed Ico files

==== Optional Pit Configuration Changes
Strategy:: Fuzzing strategy Peach will use for testing.
LoggerPath:: Directory path to folder where logs will be stored.
Agent:: The agent that will be ran to open the target program. This is generally OS dependent.
Path:: Path to the relative base directory where all pits are located.
SamplePath:: Path to the directory in which the ICO sample files are stored.  Relative to Path.

==== Configure Additional Monitors
Add monitors to agent as needed
