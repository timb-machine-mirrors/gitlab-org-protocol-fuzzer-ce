Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is an image format based on formerly patented compression techniques. It is commonly used for web images despite its licensing restraints. 

GIF consists of a short header and collection of recursive, null-terminated blocks (which contain graphic settings, color tables, comments, and pixel data).

GIF uses LZW lossless encryption for packing and can support animated images.
