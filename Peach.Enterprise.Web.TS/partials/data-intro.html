	<p>
		Data Collection section of the Pit Configurator is a series of questions and answers
		that helps the user choose the appropriate Peach Monitors for collecting resulting data from Peach.<br />
		The user may go through this process multiple times to select multiple Data Collecting monitors.
		<br />
		At the end of the Q-A the total list of Monitors chosen by the Pit Configurator will be displayed.

		Does your target produce extra files or network information that Peach may want to capture such as:
		<ul>
			<li>Disk log files?</li>
			<li>Network traffic?</li>
			<li>Console output from appropriate hardware? </li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		If you produce data from target files, network traffic, or console output, going through the Pit Data Collection section process for each file or network or output allows Peach to collect data to help you diagnose the root cause of a crash.
