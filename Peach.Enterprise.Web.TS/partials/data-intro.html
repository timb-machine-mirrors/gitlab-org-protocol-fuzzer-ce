<!-- Configure Pit: Introduction for Data Collection -->
<div>

	<p>
		Does your target produce extra files or network information that Peach may want to capture such as:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Disk log files?
			</li>
			<li>
			Network traffic?
			</li>
			<li>
			Console output from appropriate hardware?
			</li>
		</ul>
		<br />
		If you produce data from target files, network traffic, or console output, completing the Pit Data Collection section process for each file or network or output allows Peach to collect data to help you diagnose the root cause of a crash. 
		<br/>
		The Pit Data Collection section is optional. If you don't produce this kind of data or if you choose not to capture it, you may skip this section. 
		<br/>
		If you want to monitor more than one file, you will need to repeat Pit Data Collection section process for each file.
		<br/>
		You'll need the following information to complete the Pit Fault Detection section: 
		<ul>
			<li>
			Whether you want to detect a fault on a local or remote machine
			</li>
			<li>
			If the detection is done on a remote machine, the remote machine's hostname/IP name and OS 
			</li>
			<li>
			The kind of data collection (network capture, locally generated file, remote file) 
			</li>
			<li>
			Network device implement(network capture)
			</li>
			<li>
			Output file name (locally generated file)
			</li>
			<li>
			User name, authentication type and and required information, files or folders to be downloaded (remote file)
			</li>
		</ul>
