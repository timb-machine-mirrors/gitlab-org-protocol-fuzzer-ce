<!-- Configure Pit: Introduction for Data Collection -->
<div>
	<p>
		When a fault is detected, Peach Fuzzer Professional can log additional information to assist in analyzing the fault to determine the root cause. This information can include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Log files stored on disk or on remote machines via SSH</li>
		<li>Network traffic captures that can be loaded into Wireshark</li>
		<li>Serial console output from devices such as routers or switches</li>
	</ul>
	<p> 
		The Pit Data Collection section is optional. If you don't produce this kind of data or if you choose not to capture it, you may skip this section.
	</p>

	<p>If you want to monitor more than one file, you will need to repeat Pit Data Collection section process for each item you would like to collect.</p>

	<p>You'll need the following information to complete the Pit Fault Detection section:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the detection is done on a remote machine, the remote machine's hostname/IP name and OS</li>
		<li>The kind of data collection (network capture, locally generated file, remote file)</li>
		<li>Network device implement (network capture)</li>
		<li>Output file name (locally generated file)</li>
		<li>User name, authentication type and and required information, and files or folders to be downloaded (remote file)</li>
	</ul>
