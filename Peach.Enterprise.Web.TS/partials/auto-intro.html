				The Pit Automation section allows you to tell Peach to take certain actions during fuzzing iterations that you would not be able to initiate manually, like electronically flip a hardware switch or starting an process that resides on either the local or remote machine. 
				<br/>
				The Pit Automation section is optional. If you don't have the appropriate hardware or don't want to initiate a process while fuzzing, you may skip this section. 
				<br/>
				If you want to automate more than one action, you will need to repeat Pit Automation section process for each action.
				<br/>
				You'll need the following information to complete the Pit Automation section:
				<br/>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Whether you want to automate the task on a local machine or remote machine
				</li>
				<li>
				If the automation is done on a remote machine, the remote machine's hostname/IP name and OS
