[[ FROM STACK OVERFLOW]]

There is a small tool called pcaputil - it is part of the pjsip project. It should be able to decode pcap files with RTP (G.711, G.722, speex and other codecs are supported) into wav files.

Compile pjsip and find pcaputil inside pjsip-apps/bin/samples/[architecture]/.
