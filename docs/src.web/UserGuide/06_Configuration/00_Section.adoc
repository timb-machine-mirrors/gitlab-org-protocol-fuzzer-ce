[[Configuration]]
== Configuration

{product} comes with project defaults that are reasonable to start with.  For new
projects and teams just starting with {product} the configuration items that 
are most likely to need attention early on are:

. Route configuration.  Route configuration allows you to enable/disable testing
of different hosts and API apths.
. SSL client certificates.  If one or more of your services uses client certificates
for authentication, they will need to be configured.
. Authentication tokens.  Provide a list of any/all authentication tokens
along with there expiration time.  This will enable special checks just for
API authentication tokens.

It's safe to start with defaults for other project settings and tweak them
as needed.
