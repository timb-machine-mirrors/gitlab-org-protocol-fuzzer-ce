=== SSL Configuration

The SSL Configuration section is used for the following reasons:

 * Overriding global configuration
 * Client certificate auth

Client Certificate::
	Optionally specify a client certificate to use when authenticating to a target service.
	If a client certificate is specified then the _Client Key_ must also be specified.
	Certificate must be in PEM format.
	
Client Private Key::
	Optionally specify the matching secret key for the client certificate.
	If a client key is specified then the _Client Certificate_ must also be specified.
	Secret key must be in PEM format with no password.

CA Certificate::
	Optionally provide a CA certificate that will sign any auto-generated TLS certificates.
	Certificates are auto-generated for targets using TLS.
	To avoid trust issues in the traffic generator, a fixed CA certificate can be provided.
	This requires also providing the _CA Private Key_ and _Server Private Key_.
	Certificate must be in PEM format.
	
CA Private Key::
	Provide the matching CA Private Key for the CA Certificate.
	Private key must be in PEM format with no password.
	
Server Private Key::
	Provide a server private key that is used for auto-generated TLS certificates.
	Private key must be in PEM format with no password.
