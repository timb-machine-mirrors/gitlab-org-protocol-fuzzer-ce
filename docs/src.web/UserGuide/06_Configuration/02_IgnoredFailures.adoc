=== Ignored Failures

In the event that a failure is a false positive or that the team decides not to fix the issue, it 
can be added to a list of ignored failures.
When a failure is ignored the following occures:

 * Testing of this issue is still performed
 * This failure will no longer be reported via JUnit output
 * This failure will no longer be reported via ticketing integration (JIRA/Bugzilla)
 * This failure will no longer block builds
 
Any ignored failure will display in this section of the project configuration.

To re-enable reporting of an ignored failure simply click the "X" button next to it in the
project page.  You will see the item get removed from the listing.  Also the ignored
toggle button can be clicked in the failure details in the title bar of the failure.
