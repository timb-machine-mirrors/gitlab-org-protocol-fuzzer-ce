[[LogSink]]
== Log Sink

A single global log sink is automatically configured at port 512.
Logs sent to this sink during testing will be analyzed by the current testing job.
Logs are expected in syslog format which is supported by most logging frameworks.

The default syslog port (udp/512) is open on the virtual appliance.
Multiple log sources can be configured to send to this port.
The majority of logging frameworks support syslog style network logs.
If they do not, an adapter can usually be written quickly.
