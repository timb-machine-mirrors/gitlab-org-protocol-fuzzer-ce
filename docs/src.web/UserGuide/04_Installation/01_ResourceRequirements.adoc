The following are hardware recommendations for {product}.

|========
| Virtualization | Architecture | Cores | Ram  | Disk
| VMWare         | 64-bit       | 2     | 4GB  | 40GB SSD
| Virtual Box    | 64-bit       | 2     | 4GB  | 40GB SSD

The following ports are used and should be allowed as ingress for {product}.

/// This table also on the InstanceConfig section
[options="header"]
|========
| Port     | TLS | Usage
| tcp/80   | No  | RESTful API (faster than 443 when testing)
| tcp/443  | Yes | UI + Application
| udp/512  | No  | Syslog (remote logs, only open during testing)
| tcp/8000 | N/A | Proxy port (only open during testing)
| tcp/10000| Yes | Admin console
|========

Port 80 is not a hard requirement, but does increase the speed of testing.  
If company policies do not allow for HTTP usage in your test networks, open port 443 and configure
the PEACH_API setting to 'https' instead of 'http'.

==== Amazon AWS EC2

These recommendations are the same for both AWS Marketplace purchases
as well as importing a machine image.
