==== Authentication

Authentication is currently supported via an Apache reverse proxy.
Apache supports a number of authentication mechanisms from local through LDAP.
The authentication panel gives access to the Apache configuration.

===== Active Directory / LDAP

// TODO

Instructions for configuring active directory or LDAP authentication will
be included in the non-beta {peachug}.
Contact support for assistance until then.

===== Local

// TODO

Intructions for configuring local authentication will
be included in the non-beta {peachug}.
Contact support for assistance until then.
