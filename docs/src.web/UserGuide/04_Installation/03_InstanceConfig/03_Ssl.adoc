
==== SSL Certificate Installation

The instance ships with a temporary self-signed SSL certificate.
This certificate should be replaced with a custom self-signed or preferably a legitimate 
SSL certificate from your company's certificate authority.

The admin panel provides several easy to use methods for configuring SSL.
The SSL configuration for the admin panel will be used for {product} as well.
The supported configurations are:

Certificate from Certificate Authority (CA)::
    In this method all files can be set/uploaded or the admin panel can
    generate a certificate signing request (CSR) that can be sent to a
    CA to produce an SSL certificate.
    This is the recommended method.

Let's Encrypt::
    While the option for using Let's Encrypt exists in the admin panel,
    it is not supported by this virtual appliance.

Self-Signed Certificate::
    Generate a new self-signed certificate. 
    This certificate type is better than using the shipped default, but otherwise
    provides the least amount of security.

===== Certificate from CA

Use the following steps to generate a certificate signing request, 
submit it to a CA and finally install the certificate using the {product} admin portal.
