== Licensing

{product} is licensed in two ways depending on how it's purchased.
When purchased directly through {company}, {product} is 
licensed per instance.
When purchased through a cloud provider marketplace, billing occurs through
the marketplace itself for each instance that is started.

This chapter is intended for purchases made directly through {company}
as cloud marketplace purchases are automatically licensed.

For instances purchased through {company}, each instance must be activated through our licensing system.
When the instance is destroyed, it's license must be returned before it can be used again.

=== License Types

{product} has two purchase options that enable different features of the product.

{product} {skubasic}::
The {skubasic} version of {product} contains all features with the exception
of the fuzz testing modules.  This covers OWASP Top 10 and PCI 6.5, but does not
perform additional fuzz testing.
+
The checks/asserts not included with this licenses will be shown as disabled
in the project/profile configuration.

{product} {skuadvanced}::
    The {skuadvanced} version of {product} expands the {skubasic} feature set
    by adding including fuzz testing modules.

=== Licensing Concepts

Activation ID::
    Activation IDs are used to license {product} instances.
    Each purchased instance will receive it's own activation ID.
    Activation IDs can be found via the link:{portalurl}[{product} Portal]
    on the licensing page.

Device ID::
Each {poroduct} instance has a unique device id.
When an instance is activated, an activation id is associated
with a device id.
An instance's device id can be found in the Licensing section of
the Settings page.
+
To reclaim an activation id the device must be returned using the
portal.
See the reclaim license section for additional information.

==== How to identify unused activation IDs

To identify unused activation ids follow these steps.
 
===== Step 1: Access Portal

. Login to portal via link:https://dl.peachfuzzer.com[https://dl.peachfuzzer.com].
. From the top navigation select the "Licensing" button

===== Step 2: Identify Unused Activation IDs

Compare list of device ids/activation ids to list of all activation ids.
The delta between these lists are the unused activation ids.

==== How to find instance device ID

Each {oroduct} instance has a unique device id.
When an instance is activated an activation id is associated
with a device id.
An instance's device id can be found in the Licensing section of
the Settings page.

To reclaim an activation id the device must be returned using the
portal.
See the reclaim license section for instructions.

=== Reclaim license/Returning Device

An activation id/license cannot be reused unless the existing activated device
is returned, freeing up the license for re-use.
Perform the following steps to return a device.

==== Step 1: Identify Device ID to Return

The easiest method to determine the correct device id assumes the activated 
instance is still running and available.

. Access {product} in the normal manner
. Navigate to the Settings page using the top navigation links
. Scroll down to the Licesning section
. The device id is listed.

.Device ID

If the instance is no longer available, the device ID must be identified
from the list of registered devices.  This could include checking the device
id's of all available instances to determine which device id is not in active
use.

==== Step 2: Access Portal

. Login to portal via link:https://dl.peachfuzzer.com[https://dl.peachfuzzer.com].
. From the top navigation select the "Flexera Portal" button
. Flexera licensing portal will load

==== Step 3: Search Devices

. Click on the Search Devices link

.Search Devices

==== Step 4: Return Device

. Select "Action -> Return Device"

.Return Device
image::{images}/Licensing/Return_Device_ClickReturnDevice.png[]

==== Step 5: Verify Device Removed

. Navigate to the Licensing page on the portal
. Verify the device id is no longer listed

==== Step 6: Destroy Instance

If the instance who's license was just returned is still active, it should
be terminated/removed to avoid breaking the licensing terms.

=== Licensing Expiring Warning

{product} will display a warning alert in the UI when the instance 
license is near expiration.  This is intended to provide time to 
acquire a new license and re-activate the instance.  If you're seeing the
license expiration warning, please contact {product} sales to assist in
renewing your license.

=== How to purchase additional licenses

Additional licenses can be purchased through the {product} sales team via sales@peachfuzzer.com.
