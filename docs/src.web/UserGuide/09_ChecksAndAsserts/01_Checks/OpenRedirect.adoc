Tests redirects to determine if they can be abused by attackers.
This check only operates when a parameter's value is detected in a redirect.

Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web 
application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web
application to redirect the request to a URL contained within
untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious
site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and 
steal user credentials. Because the server name in the modified
link is identical to the original site, phishing attempts may
have a more trustworthy appearance. Unvalidated redirect and
forward attacks can also be used to maliciously craft a URL
that would pass the applicationâ€™s access control check and then
forward the attacker to privileged functions that they would 
normally not be able to access.
