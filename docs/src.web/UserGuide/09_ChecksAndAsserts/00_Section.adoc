[[ChecksAndAsserts]]
== Checks and Asserts

{product} is built on the concept of Checks that generate tests and Asserts that
check to see if the test pass or failed.  Some checks allow the user to modify
and configure which Asserts are performed.  This gives the end user allot of 
flexibility, especially around limiting the number of false positives that 
the system generates.

This section includes information about each Check and Assert.  This 
information includes operation and configuration of each component.
