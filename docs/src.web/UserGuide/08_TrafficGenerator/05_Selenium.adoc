Selenium test cases can be used with {product} via exporting them to a supported framework.
For example, the JUnit 4 integration has an example of using exported Selenium test cases.
The exported Selenium test cases have been modified to set the Proxy value in the target
web driver.

TIP: Modify the selenium output to cache the Web Driver.  The examples included in the JUnit 4 test runner
SDK folder provide an example of this.
