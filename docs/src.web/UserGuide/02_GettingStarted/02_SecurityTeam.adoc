=== Manual Usage/Security Team/Red Team

Use by individual testers such as redteam members or penetration testers can be achieved in several ways:

 * A custom traffic generator script can be written in a language known by the tester such as Python.
These scripts are easy and quick to author- existing sample code can be used in many cases.

 * Selenium Firefox plugin can be used to record a web session.
Selenium then exports to formats like JUnit that have Peach integrations.

 * Automated tests from the engineering group can be used with one of the {product} test runner
 plugins.

 * Attack proxies can forward input into Peach for testing.
For example Burp Repeater can be used to forward requests through Peach multiple times.
