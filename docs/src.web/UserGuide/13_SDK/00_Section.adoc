=== SDK Contents

The {product} SDK contains various integrations, examples and samples.
The SDK is organized by category as outlined below.

SDK Contents:

ci\::
   CI/CD integrations.  Currently only a generic CI
   integration is included that works with all CI
   systems.
   
cli\::
   Peach API Security command line interface.

issuetrackers\::
   Integrations with issue trackers such as JIRA and
   bugzilla.  These are also good examples to base
   custom integrations on.

libraries\::
+
Libraries in different languages for accessing the
{product} API.  These libraries are used
by the various CI integrations and test runners.
+
These libraries are also used when creating custom
traffic generators or CI integrations.
 
scripts\::
   Example scripts that can be configured with routes
   to provide advanced authentication methods.  These
   tend to include HMACs of request content.  An
   example would be Amazon AWS authentication.
 
targets\::
   Sample targets that can be tested with {product}.
   The provided examples make use of these test targets.
 
testrunners\::
   Test framework integrations.  This includes
   frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, PyUnit, py.test, etc.
 
docker-compose.yml::
   Creates an example target with Jenkins installed.

run_test*::
   Scripts to run Peach API Security jobs from the 
   commandline instead of via a CI/CD system. Scripts
   included for both Linux and Windows.  Some are
   also specific to different test runnders.


=== Targets

Test targets included in SDK.

==== Flask Rest Target

The flask rest target is a working example of a REST API backed by a SQLite database.
The example target contains one or more SQL injection vulnerabilities that can be 
identified by fuzzing the API. This example is coded in Python using the Flask framework.

===== Important Files

_Target Rest Service_

rest_target.html::
	Very simple UI for Selenium demo

rest_target.py::
	Start target API service using 'http'.  +python rest_target.py+

rest_ssl_target.py::
	Start target API service using 'https' with yourserver.crt and yourserver.key.
    +python rest_ssl_target.py+

_Example TLS Certificates and Keys_

yourserver.crt::
	Example TLS certificate used by rest_ssl_target.py
	
yourserver.key::
	Example TLS private key used by rest_ssl_target.pyh
	
rootCA.pem::
	Example TLS CA certificate that can be used by Peach

rootCA.key::
	Example TLS CA Private key that can be used by peach
	
clientcert.crt::
	Example TLS Client Certificate that can be used to demo
	client cert authentication.
	
clientcert.key::
	Example TLS Client Private Key that can be used to demo
	client cert authentication.

===== Usage

. Run test target
. Select a traffic generator. Each testrunner includes an example that works with the flask target.
. Kick off a test run using included SDK scripts (run_test*) as example.
. View results in {product} web interface

===== Logging & Fault Detection

The Rest Target logs to the console and also syslog to host 127.0.0.1.
The provided {product} automatically listens for Syslog messages to monitor.
