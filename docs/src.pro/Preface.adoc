[[Preface]]
== Preface

This book is the official documentation of {product}. Written by the {product} team, this documentation represents a concerted effort to fully document all of the {product} features.

Peach Fuzzer has been in active development through three major revisions since 2004. Since then, no complete documentation has existed.
Documenting Peach is an on-going effort. The majority of effort has been placed in documenting the most common uses of {product}.

=== What is {product}?

{product} (Peach) is a fuzzer for data consumers. Peach is a smart fuzzer that operates by performing the following actions:

* Understand the data structure and the flows of the test target
* Create and feed malformed data to the test target
* Monitor the test target to record interesting information when unintended or undesirable behavior occurs (monitors include debuggers and network packet sniffers)

Peach is a versatile product and has been used to fuzz a wide range of products and devices:

* web browsers (file consumers)
* web servers (network servers)
* mobile devices (such as Android iOS)
* robots
* SCADA systems
* Semiconductor chips

Because Peach can easily extend its interfacing and monitoring, it is the most adaptable fuzzer that exists.

=== A Brief History of Peach

Peach Fuzzer has been in active development since 2004. Since then it has gone through three major versions:

*Peach v1*

Peach v1 was written in 2004 during the PH-Neutral conference in Berlin Germany.
Peach was the first fuzzer to take a more object-oriented approach.
Because Peach was originally written in Python, this version required writing Python code to target and utilize.

*Peach v2*

Peach v2 was a complete redesign of Peach based on the lessons learned developing and using the first version.
It introduced all of the core concepts still used in Peach today.

Because Peach v2 was the first true modeling fuzzer available, it became widely used in the industry.
This was the first Peach version to use the three M's approach to fuzzing: Model, Mutate, and Monitor.
Peach v2 still required writing Python code to target and utilize.

*Peach v3*

Peach had outgrown Python as a language so Peach v3 was rewritten using the Microsoft .NET environment and the C# language.

In Peach v3, the core concepts remain the same, but the internals were re-architected to allow for the next generation of features.
The fuzzing definitions (Pits) are largely backwards compatible with the prior version.
Peach v3 introduced Peach Farm, the tool set for scaling fuzzing and for controlling fuzzing server farms.

Peach is currently developed and maintained by Peach Fuzzer, LLC, in Seattle, WA.
