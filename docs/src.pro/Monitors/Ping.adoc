== Ping Monitor

The _Ping_ monitor verifies whether a device is functioning by sending a packet to a target location, 
and waiting for a response from the device. _Ping_ continues to monitor until either a _Timeout_ occurs 
or a response from the target device reaches the _Ping_ monitor. 

Ping runs at the end of each iteration. 

_Ping_ can validate that a target is still up or is waiting to restart. This is useful when fuzzing 
embedded devices that crash surreptitiously.

Additionally, by using the FaultOnSuccess parameter, _Ping_ can help you to verify whether 
or not a new device at a specific address becomes available, or that a nonfunctioning device 
starts to function. For example, if you are fuzzing a device that programmatically turns 
other computers on, you can use _Ping_ with *FaultOnSuccess=true* to determine whether the 
computers are off (an uninteresting result) or on (an interesting result). 

The Peach command line option +--showdevices+ causes Peach to generate a list of all available network interfaces. For a sample device listing, see the the xref:Monitors_Pcap[Pcap Network] monitor.

NOTE: When running Mono (for Linux and OS X systems), Ping needs administrative or root privileges. In addition, the output string for Mono is limited to 100 bytes, including 28 bytes needed for the IP and ICMP.

=== Parameters

_Required:_

Host:: Host name or IP address to ping.

_Optional:_

Data:: Data to send in the ping packet.
FaultOnSuccess:: Fault if ping is successful, defaults to false.
Timeout:: Timeout value expressed in milliseconds, defaults to 1,000.

=== Return codes

If a ping is successful, the _Ping_ monitor records IPStatus.Success. Other return values indicate a failure. the following table lists and describes the possible return codes.

|==========================================================
|Return code   |Description |
|IPStatus.Success:   |Reply from <device>: bytes=<count> time=<elapsed time>ms TTL=<time remaining>.|
|IPStatus.Unknown:   |The ICMP echo request failed for an unknown reason.|
|IPStatus.DestinationNetworkUnreachable:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the network that contains the destination computer is not reachable.|
|IPStatus.DestinationHostUnreachable:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the destination computer is not reachable.|
|IPStatus.DestinationProhibited:   |The ICMP echo request failed because contact with the destination computer is administratively prohibited.|
|IPStatus.DestinationPortUnreachable:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the port on the destination computer is not available.|
|IPStatus.NoResources:   |The ICMP echo request failed because of insufficient network resources.|
|IPStatus.BadOption:   |The ICMP echo request failed because it contains an invalid option.|
|IPStatus.HardwareError:   |The ICMP echo request failed because of a hardware error.|
|IPStatus.PacketTooBig:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the packet containing the request is larger than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of a node (router or gateway) located between the source and destination. The MTU defines the maximum size of a transmittable packet.|
|IPStatus.TimedOut:   |The ICMP echo reply was not received within the allotted time.|
|IPStatus.BadRoute:   |The ICMP echo request failed because there is no valid route between the source and destination computers.|
|IPStatus.TtlExpired:   |The ICMP echo request failed because its Time to Live (TTL) value reached zero, causing the forwarding node (router or gateway) to discard the packet.|
|IPStatus.TtlReassemblyTimeExceeded:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the packet was divided into fragments for transmission and all of the fragments were not received within the time allotted for reassembly.|
|IPStatus.ParameterProblem:   |The ICMP echo request failed because a node (router or gateway) encountered problems while processing the packet header.|
|IPStatus.SourceQuench:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the packet was discarded. This occurs when the source computer's output queue has insufficient storage space, or when packets arrive at the destination too quickly to be processed.|
|IPStatus.BadDestination:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the destination IP address cannot receive ICMP echo requests or should never appear in the destination address field of any IP datagram.|
|IPStatus.DestinationUnreachable:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the destination computer that is specified in an ICMP echo message is not reachable; the exact cause of problem is unknown.|
|IPStatus.TimeExceeded:   |The ICMP echo request failed because its Time to Live (TTL) value reached zero, causing the forwarding node (router or gateway) to discard the packet.|
|IPStatus.BadHeader:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the header is invalid.|
|IPStatus.UnrecognizedNextHeader:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the Next Header field does not contain a recognized value. The Next Header field indicates the extension header type (if present) or the protocol above the IP layer, for example, TCP or UDP.|
|IPStatus.IcmpError:   |The ICMP echo request failed because of an ICMP protocol error.|
|IPStatus.DestinationScopeMismatch:   |The ICMP echo request failed because the source address and destination address that are specified in an ICMP echo message are not in the same scope. This is typically caused by a router forwarding a packet using an interface that is outside the scope of the source address. Address scopes (link-local, site-local, and global scope) determine where on the network an address is valid.|
