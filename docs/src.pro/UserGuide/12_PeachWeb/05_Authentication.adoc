=== Authenticated Services

Most service authentication mechanisms work automatically with Peach Web with only two main exceptions.
Mechanisms that work include:

 * Cookie based auth
 * Username/password over TLS
 * API Token

The two authentication types that require some special configuration are:

 * TLS User Certificates
 * Hashed/computed keys.  For example, AWS authentication includes the hash of headers and body.

==== TLS User Certificates

TLS user certificates are well supported by Peach Web and only require small configuration changes to get working.

==== Hashed/computed keys
