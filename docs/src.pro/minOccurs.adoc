[[minOccurs]]

== Minimum Occurrence Attribute

The occurrence attributes are used to define how often an element can occur.  The _minOccurs_ attribute specifies the minimum number of times an element can occur.  The occurrence attributes _minOccurs_ and xref:maxOccurs[maxOccurs] can be combined to provide the occurrence range of an element.  Occurrence attributes are used when cracking and producing_mutating data. Internally Peach will treat this element as an array.
