== Minimum Occurrence Attribute

_minOccurs_ specifies the minimum number of times an element can occur.  

Peach will treat _minOccurs_ as an array.

Occurrence attributes are used when cracking, producing, and mutating data; they define how often an element can occur. 

The occurrence attributes _minOccurs_ and xref:maxOccurs[maxOccurs] can be combined to provide an element's occurrence range.

Related attributes: xref:maxOccurs[maxOccurs], xref:occurs[occurs].
