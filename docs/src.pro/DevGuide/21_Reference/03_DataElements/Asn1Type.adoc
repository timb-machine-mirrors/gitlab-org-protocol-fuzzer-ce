The _Asn1Type_ specifies the type information of an ASN.1 data element. This element combines with the Asn1Tag and Asn1Length data elements to provide a complete description of an ASN.1 data element. ASN.1 data elements can be primitive (pre-defined) or constructed.

TIP: This element exists for manually coding ASN.1 data elements. An alternative is to use the ASN.1 analyzer that can generate an ASN.1 data model, and produces instances of this element in the resulting data model.

=== Syntax

[source,xml]
----
<Asn1Type tag="1553DroneStream" />
----

=== Attributes
_Required:_

*tag*:: Name of the ASN.1 tag associated with this type.

_Optional:_

*class*:: 4-byte integer containing ASN.1 Class value, default is "0". +
[horizontal]
  0::: Universal class.
  1::: Application class.
  2::: Context-specific class.
  3::: Private class.
[vertical]
xref:constraint[constraint]:: Scripting expression that evaluates to true or false, default is "".
*forceMultiByteIdentifier*:: If "true", use multiple identifier octets to contain the identifer of the Asn.1 element. +
If "false", store the entire tag in the last 5-bits of the first octet. The value of the tag must be 30 or less. +
The default is "false".
*indefiniteLength*:: If "true", use the indefinite encoding form of the Asn.1 element. The indefinite
form requires an end-of-content block. +
If "false", use definite encoding form, where the number of content octets is known and the octets are available. +
The default is "false".
*longLength*:: If "true", always use the long encoding form (that is, mulitple length octects) to express the length of the Asn.1 element. +
If "false", also allow the short encoding form where the number of content octets is expressed in 7 bits (127 or less). +
The default is "false".
xref:mutable[mutable]:: Is this element mutable, default is "true".
xref:name[name]:: Element name, default is "true".
*pc*:: 4-byte integer that specifies whether the ASN.1 element is a primitive or a
    constructed element. The default is "0" which indicates a primitive element.
xref:token[token]:: Is this element a token for parsing, default is "false".

=== Child Elements

xref:Asn1Length[Asn1Length]:: Specifies the number of content octets in an ASN.1 element.
xref:Asn1Tag[Asn1Tag]:: Specifies the identifier tag of an ASN.1 data element.
xref:Asn1Type[Asn1Type]:: Asn1Type of a child ASN.1 data element.
xref:Blob[Blob]:: Represents binary data (array of bytes) to create simple dumb fuzzers in Peach.
xref:Block[Block]:: Groups one or more data elements in a logical structure.
xref:Choice[Choice]:: Indicates that all of the sub-elements are valid; but, only one
    sub-element should be selected.
xref:Flags[Flags]::  Defines a set of bit-sized flags.
xref:Number[Number]:: Defines a binary number of arbitrary bit size.
xref:Padding[Padding]:: Pads variably sized blocks or data models provide size uniformity or consistency.
xref:Placement[Placement]:: Relocates an element after it has been cracked.
xref:Stream[Stream]:: Groups one or more data elements in a logical structure.
xref:String[String]:: Character sequence consisting of ASCII or Unicode characters.
xref:XmlAttribute[XmlAttribute]:: Performs static transformations such as compression or encoding.
xref:XmlElement[XmlElement]:: Defines an XML element, the basic building block of XML documents.
xref:Fixup[Fixup]:: Performs dynamic transformations such as checksums and CRCs.
xref:Hint[Hint]:: Provides information to mutators.
xref:Transformer[Transformer]:: Performs static transformations such as compression or encoding.
xref:Relation[Relation]:: Identifies a type of relationship with another data element, such as count.
xref:Analyzers[Analyzer]:: Analyzes current element post cracking, can dynamically change model.

=== Mutators

Peach uses the Asn1Type, Asn1Tag, and Asn1Length data elements to create a data model
that consists of elements such as strings, numbers, binary data and blocks.
This "downstream" data model is data consumer and the target that Peach fuzzes.

In short, Peach does not fuzz the Asn1Type, Asn1Tag, or Asn1Length elements.
