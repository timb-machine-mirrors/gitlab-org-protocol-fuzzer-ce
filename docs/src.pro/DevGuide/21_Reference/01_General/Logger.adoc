[[Logger]]
== Loggers

A logger records the fuzzing run (including any faults) and data collected by monitors.

IMPORTANT: If a logger is not configured, this information will not be stored.

{product} includes a file system logger. The logging system is extensible, allowing you to add custom loggers by writing  plug-ins.

[[Loggers_File]]
=== File

The file system logger needs a specified path.  Peach creates a folder containing the run name and time stamp.  Inside of this folder are the actual logs.  Until the first fault emerges, Peach logs very little information to conserve disk space.
