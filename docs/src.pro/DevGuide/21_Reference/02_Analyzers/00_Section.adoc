_Analyzers_ are classes that parse some form of data and build a Peach Document Object Model (DOM) or a partial _DataModel_.  Examples of data that can be easily parsed are XML and ASN.1.

Using an _Analyzer_ can incredibly reduce the time needed to begin smart fuzzing since the time spent creating a precise _DataModel_ can be avoided.

xref:Analyzers_Asn1[Asn1]:: Converts ASN.1 data in _Blobs_ into a full data model.
xref:Analyzers_Binary[Binary]:: Breaks up unknown data when strings are found.
xref:Analyzers_Json[JSON]:: Converts JSON data in a _String_ into a full data model.
xref:Analyzers_Regex[Regex]:: Use regular expressions to parse strings. Supports regular expression named groups.
xref:Analyzers_StringToken[StringToken]:: Separates strings using a precedence based list of punctuation. The strings are used to form the resulting _DataModel_.
xref:Analyzers_Xml[Xml]:: Converts XML contained in a _string_ element into a data model of _XmlElement_ and _XmlAttribute_ types.
xref:Analyzers_Zip[Zip]:: Converts zipped data in a _blob_ into a data model of _stream_ elements.
