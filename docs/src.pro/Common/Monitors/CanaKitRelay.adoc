== CanaKitRelay Monitor

*Monitor category*: *Automation*

The _CanaKitRelay_ monitor provides automation to a number of test configurations:

* Control power to an external device that is the fuzzing target. You can turn it on at
the start of the test, then toggle power after a fault occurs to return the device to a
known, stable state.
* Control a supporting device in a fuzzing test configuration. Supporting devices can
include recording devices, lighting, heating devices, sound or motion generators, even
turning on an espresso machine after every 10,000th test iteration.
* Emulate a button push by inserting the device into a circuit containing the button.
The idea is to automate the press of a button, such as `NumLock`, or the play button on
a surveillance device.
* For simulating the attachment or removal of a cable, such as USB, by routing the power
line (VCC) through the relay.

The Cana Kit is an external product that you can add as part of your test configuration.
The kit consists of 4 relays. A relay is an electrically operated switch that uses an
electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism. Each relay in the kit is capable of
controlling a 5-amp, 110V AC or a 24V DC circuit. Communication with the kit occurs
over USB.

For more information on the kit, including configurations, installation, and the relay
command set, see http://www.canakit.com/catalog/product/view/id/627/s/4-port-usb-relay-controller[Cana Kit 4-Port USB Relay Controller].

You can purchase the Cana Kit from the manufacturer at previous web site or from
Amazon.com. In each case, the kit price is about $60.00 U.S. plus shipping costs.

The _CanaKitRelay_ monitor controls one relay in a kit. Use one monitor per relay to
control multiple relays concurrently. Within a fuzzing session, the monitor can trigger
the relay at the following times:

* At the start or end of a fuzzing run
* At the start or end of each test iteration
* After detecting a fault
* At the start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault


The following diagram shows a sample configuration that controls power through Relay 1.

image::{images}/Common/Monitors/CanaKitRelay.png[scalewidth="75%"]

Each relay supplies three terminals: Normally Open (NO), Common (COM), and Normally Closed (NC). Basic configurations will connect the hot wire to Common and the other wire to either NO or NC. For DC connections, attach the anode (+) to the Common terminal.

NO provides an open circuit when the relay is off. NC provides a closed circuit when the relay is off, giving opposite on/off states from NO. The following diagram shows the terminal layout and imagines that Relay 1 is On.

TIP: The CanaKit Relay requires a driver that is available at the supplier's website.
At the time of this writing, the driver is unsigned, which forces you to turn off Driver
Signing Enforcement when installing the driver in 64-bit Windows 8. For instructions on how to install unsigned drivers in this environment, see http://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/[How to Disable Driver Signature Verification on 64-Bit Windows 8.1].

After installing the Cana Kit device driver, connect the unit to your PC. Windows
dynamically assigns a serial port to the USB channel for the connection. You can see the
port assignment by looking at the `Ports(COM and LPT)` entry in the Device Manager.
The Device Manager is available from the System applet in the Control Panel.

NOTE: For controlling power to devices using 3-prong outlets, Peach provides a monitor for the xref:Monitors_IpPower9258[IpPower9258 Network AC Power Controller Network AC Power].

=== Parameters

_Required:_

SerialPort:: Serial port for the board (such as COM2).

RelayNumber:: Relay to trigger (1, 2, 3, or 4). Each relay number corresponds to a single relay in the kit, as shown in the first diagram.

_Optional:_

Action::
+
Perform an action on the specified relay, defaults to ToggleOff. Valid actions include the following:
+
[cols="2,4" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|Action     |Description
|ToggleOff  |Sets the relay to the OFF position, then sets the relay to the ON position.
|ToggleOn   |Sets the relay to the ON position, then sets the relay to the OFF position.
|SetOn      |Sets the relay to the ON position.
|SetOff     |Sets the relay to the OFF position.
|==========================================================

ToggleDelay:: Pause in milliseconds between off/on, defaults to 500 ms--1/2 second. +
Formerly named OnOffPause.

When::
+
Details on when to perform a specified action. Specify one of the following values:
+
[cols="1,2" options="header",halign="center"]
|==========================================================
|"When" Setting              |Description
|DetectFault                 |Perform the action when checking for the faulting condition. Requires a regular expression in the +CheckValue+ parameter. Default mode of operation.
|OnStart                     |Run the command when fuzzing session starts. Command runs once per session.
|OnEnd                       |Run the command when fuzzing session stops. Command runs run once per session.
|OnIterationStart            |Run the command at start of each iteration.
|OnIterationEnd              |Run the command at end of each iteration.
|OnFault                     |Run the command when Peach detects a fault.
|OnIterationStartAfterFault  |Run the command at start of an iteration that immediately follows a fault detection.
|OnCall                      |Trigger the command to run from the state model. The command runs when the _StartOnCall_ message is received.

=== Examples

.Reset power on Relay 1 +

ifdef::peachug[]

This parameter example is from a setup that uses the CanaKitRelay monitor to reset relay{nbsp}1, which toggles the power off, then back on. A device attached to this relay will restart when the relay resets. Note that the reset does not occur on every iteration, but  once at the start of a fuzzing session, or perhaps, after a fault occurs.

|==========================================================
|Parameter            |Value
|SerialPort           |`COM5`
|RelayNumber          |`1`
|ResetEveryIteration  |`false`
|==========================================================

endif::peachug[]


ifndef::peachug[]

This example uses the CanaKitRelay monitor to reset relay{nbsp}1, which toggles the power off, then back on. A device attached to this relay will restart when the relay resets. Note that the reset does not occur on every iteration, but  once at the start of a fuzzing session, or perhaps, when after a fault occurs.
