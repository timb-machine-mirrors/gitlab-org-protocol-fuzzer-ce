== Installation

Installing {product} on any of the supported platforms is a straightforward and easy process. The following sections list the steps needed to install Peach on different operating systems and begins with using the license to download the product files.  The items from Peach are contained in a single download-able zip file that includes Peach, a copy of the license, Peach Pits and/or Pit Packs.

TIP: When fuzzing, many security products (such as anti-virus programs) can interfere or slowdown fuzzing. For network fuzzing, make sure none of the network or host-based network intrusion detection systems (IDS) are running. For file fuzzing, disable anti-virus software; or mark Peach, the target application, and any directories that might have files used in fuzzing, as out of scope for real time monitoring.

[[InstallLicenseGlobally]]
=== {product} License

{product} is licensed on a per-concurrent instance basis for a one year duration.

Peach Fuzzer, LLC, delivers licenses via email after each purchase, typically
within 24 hours during the business week. The filename of the Peach Fuzzer license, _Peach.license_, is the same for all operating system platforms.

When the license arrives, place a copy of it in one of the following folders:

* Main Peach Fuzzer folder. For a new installation or a side-by-side update, create a folder near the root of the file system, such as "C:\peach" or "/usr/tools/peach". If you choose another location, the path should be short and should not contain spaces.

NOTE: The side-by-side installation results in having multiple Peach Fuzzer installations on the file system.

* Current Peach Fuzzer folder. You can install a Peach update over the existing installation by installing to the current Peach folder. Again, if possible, use a folder that is near the file system root, such as "C:\peach" or "/usr/tools/peach".

* Separate license folder. Placing the license here provides a location for the license that will not be overwritten by an update.

 ** On Windows, the alternate directory is located at _%PROGRAMDATA%\Peach\_.
 ** For Linux and OS X systems, the alternate directory is _/usr/share/peach/_.

NOTE: If you wish to use the alternate folder, you will need to create it.
