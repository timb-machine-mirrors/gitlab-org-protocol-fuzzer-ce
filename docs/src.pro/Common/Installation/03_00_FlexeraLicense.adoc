=== Peach FuzzFlex

Peach FuzzFlex is a flexible licensing model which allows users to purchase test cases in batches of 100k.
Each test case that Peach executes is considered one 'use' of the Peach license against the total number of test cases purchased.

During the delivery, Peach will create a user profile that can be used to access the Peach Fuzzer download site.
The user can also be used to access the Licensing Operations Portal, used to check usage statistics, via the download site.
The download site is available at link:https://dl.peachfuzzer.com[https://dl.peachfuzzer.com].

Peach FuzzFlex can be deployed in one of two ways:

xref:License_FuzzFlex_CLS[Cloud License Server (Online Synchronization)]::
    This scenario is sufficient for most customers.
    A persistent connection to the Internet is required for this option.
    It is much easier to use this deployment option since a Cloud License Server
    will be automatically provisioned and managed for you.

xref:License_FuzzFlex_LLS[Local License Server (Offline Synchronization)]::
Users who wish to use Peach FuzzFlex without having access to the Internet can deploy a
Local License Server onsite to provide offline activation and synchronization of licensing
information.

Deploying a local license server requires changes to your account.
Please contact licensing@peachfuzzer.com for more information about the process.

===== Java Prerequisites

The following are the Java prerequisites for the machine on which the Local License Server is installed:

* Oracle JRE 1.8 or OpenJDK 1.8
* A 64-bit JRE for a 64-bit license server or a 32-bit JRE for a 32-bit license server
(not adhering to this requirement can cause the license server to fail to start)
* The JAVA_HOME (or JRE_HOME) environment variable on your system set to the path for your default JDK (or JRE) installation

NOTE: The license server requires only the JRE component.
If JRE is your default Java installation,
set the JRE_HOME environment variable;
if JDK is your default installation,
set JAVA_HOME.

===== Using Peach FuzzFlex

Once your organization has a Local License Server installed and running
(this may require the assistance of an IT administrator)
the Peach license configuration must be updated.
You can use the same license configuration for any machine intended to run
Peach FuzzFlex across your entire organization.

Follow these steps to update your local configuration.
To update the local configuration you will need the Local License Server URL.
In general, the URL should be of the form: +http://HOST:PORT/request+.
An example of a Local License Server URL is +http://192.168.1.2:7070/request+.

NOTE: For more information on determining the Local License Server URL,
see the 'FlexNet Embedded 2016 R2 License Server Administration Guide' found
in the installation folder as a file named +FNE_LicenseServerAdminGuide_2016R2.pdf+.

1. Edit the file +Peach.license.config+ located in your Peach install folder.
2. Replace +LOCAL_LICENSE_SERVER_URL+ with the Local License Server URL.
3. Restart Peach.

Example of an updated file is:

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="licenseUrl" value="http://192.168.1.2:7070/request" />
    <add key="activationId" value="0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000-0000" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
----

NOTE: The +activationId+ setting in the +Peach.license.config+ file should already be
set for you by the download process.
You only need to focus on modifying the +licenseUrl+ setting.
