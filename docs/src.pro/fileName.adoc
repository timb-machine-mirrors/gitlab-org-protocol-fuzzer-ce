[[fileName]]
== fileName ==

_fileName_ can specify a single file ("+sample.png+"), or multiple files by pointing to a folder ("+samples+") or providing a file glob ("+samples_*.jpg+") when used with the xref:Data[Data] element.

If a folder or file glob specifies multiple files, the _switchCount_  attribute with the xref:MutationStrategies[random strategy] can be used to specify the number of iterations performed before switching to the next file.

IMPORTANT: Multiple files are only supported by the random mutation strategy!
