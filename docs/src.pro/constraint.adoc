[[constraint]]
== Constraint Attribute ==

The constraint attribute specifies a scripting expression that helps Peach identify if the data element has been properly consumed for incoming data. 

The constraint expression evaluates to true (the incoming data was properly parsed into the data element) or false (an error has occurred). 

The constraint attribute does not affect how the value is mutated.

NOTE: Constraints are only executed when parsing data into a data element.

TIP: Constraints are typically slower than using either xref:Choice[Choice] or the _token_ attribute

The following special variables are available to the expression:

element:: The data element instance
value:: The value of the data cracked into the data element.  This value is cast to a string or to a byte array.

=== Example ===

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Operate on number and check result -->
<Number name="constrainedNum" size="32" constraint="int(value) & 0xfefe == 5" />
----

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Case insensitive equals -->
<String constraint="value.lower() == 'peach'" />

<!-- Value contains peach -->
<String constraint="value.find('peach') != -1" />
----

[source,xml]
----
<!-- Length is less than 100 bytes -->
<Blob constraint="len(value) < 100" />
