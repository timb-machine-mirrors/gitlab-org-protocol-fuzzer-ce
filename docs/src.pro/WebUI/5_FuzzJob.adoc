=== Fuzzing Session

With your Pit configured and tested, you're ready to start fuzzing!

In review, you need a configured Pit to run a fuzzing session. 

. From the Home screen, click the Library menu.
. From your Pits Library screen, select a configuration. +
The configurations are listed in the section that follows the Pits.

Once selected, the configured Pit displays, as in the following illustration.

image::{images}/webui_config_selected.png[]

If needed, you can to change configuration settings or set some other parameters at the buttom of the page (typcially used in replaying a fuzzing session). Click Start to begin the fuzzing session. The Peach Dashboard displays. 

image::{images}/webui_dashboard_oct2015.png[]

The dashboard allows you to monitor Peach while your fuzzing job runs and provides launch capability for new fuzzing jobs. The Peach Dashboard provides the following information:

* The Configuration name, above the colored status bar
* The time the job started
* The duration that the job has been running
* The number of fuzzing test cases per hour
* The seed ID for random number generation, so you can replicate the test, if needed
* Number of test cases completed
* Total number of faults found in this run
* A summary of the most recent faults. 

NOTES:

. The seed ID influences the fuzzing that occurs during a fuzzing job. If you want to replicate a test, the seed value is required to reproduce the exact sequence of values from the random-number generator used in fuzzing.
. The job control buttons are enabled when using a Pit from the Pit Library. Using the job control buttons on the dashboard allows you to start, stop and pause the job from the web interface.
. The Job Control STOP button does NOT close Peach. The STOP button only allows you to stop the currently running job. 
. If you have stopped a job and wish to start a new job using a different pit, you can only use predefined pits from the {peachweb} Dashboard.
. The fault summary lists the most recent faults. For information about the faults generated during this fuzzing session, click the Metrics menu, then Faults on the left side of the screen .

=== Faults

While {product} is running, you can view all the faults generated during the session by clicking the Faults menu option on the left.

Faults displays the total number of generated faults. There are two Faults views: the Summary view and the Detail view:

image::{images}/Fault_summary.png[]

For each session, the Faults Summary view lists a summary of information about the fault such as:

* Identified fault iteration count
* Time and date
* Monitor that detected the fault
* Risk (if known)
* Unique identifiers of the fault (major and minor hashes), if available

Clicking on one of the listed faults from the Summary view opens the Details view for the selected fault.

Here's where you can find details about the selected fault. Additional information (such as any files collected during the data collection phase) are located in the disk log folder.

=== Metrics

A number of metrics are available for viewing while {product} is running.

TIP: The data grids used on many of the metrics displays support multi-column sorting using the _shift_ key and clicking on the different columns to sort.

==== Bucket Timeline

This metric display shows a timeline with new fault buckets listed, and total number of times the bucket was found during the fuzzing session.

image::{images}/webui_metrics_timeline.png[]

==== Faults Over Time

This metric display shows the count of faults found by hour over the course of the fuzzing run. This is the count of all faults found, not just unique buckets.

==== Mutators

This metric display shows statistics for each mutator by arranging the information into columns:

[horizontal]
Element Count:: The number of elements this mutator touched with mutated data.
Iteration Count:: The number of iterations this mutator was used during the fuzzing job.
Bucket Count:: The number of unique buckets found while this mutator was in use.
Fault Count:: The number of faults found while this mutator was in use.

image::{images}/webui_metrics_mutators.png[]

==== Elements

This metric display shows statistics for all of the elements in your Pit. 

This display shows several columns of information:

[horizontal]
State:: The state this element belongs to
Action:: The action this element belongs to
Parameter:: The parameter this action belongs to (if any). Parameters are used only with actions of type _call_.
Element:: The full name of the element and its associated DataModel.
Mutations:: The number of mutations generated from this element.    
Buckets:: The number of unique buckets found by sending mutating data to this element.
Faults:: The number of faults found from the mutated data sent to this element.

image::{images}/webui_metrics_elements.png[]

==== States

This metric display presents statistics that are relevant for pits that have state models with more than two or more states. This display shows the number of times a specific state occurred during the fuzzing session. Seldom-used states might hide issues or indicate a problem. 

For example, not all states always execute. If an early-occurring state is fuzzed, the outcome of the fuzzing could prevent states that are used late in the state flow from occurring. 

NOTE: Over time, the number of occurrences for most states should trend towards equality.

==== Data Sets

This metric display shows statistics related to the use of two or more data sets in the fuzzing session. This is useful to determine the origin of unique buckets and also faults in terms of the data sources used in mutating.

This display shows several columns of information:

[horizontal]
Data Set:: Name of the data set
Iterations:: Number of fuzzing iterations performed using this data set
Buckets:: Number of unique buckets found with this data set
Faults:: Number of faults found with this data set

image::{images}/webui_metrics_datasets.png[]

==== Buckets

This metric display shows the buckets encountered during the fuzzing job. Several columns of information show:

[horizontal]
Fault bucket:: Identifier of the fault that occurred
Mutator:: The mutator that generated the fault
Iteration count:: The number of iterations that used the mutator
Faults count:: The number of faults that occurred while using the mutator

image::{images}/webui_metrics_buckets.png[]

==== Accessing Raw Metrics Data

The raw data is collected in a SQLite database that is stored in the logs folder. 

IMPORTANT: Let the fuzzing job complete as well as writes to the database. Once these complete, then you can access the database without the risk of establishing a lock that could interfere with the data storage process.

=== Documentation

The Documentation menu option opens the product documentation in HTML format. This documentation is also available on disk in the +docs+ folder, or in PDF format as +Peach_Pro_User_Guide.pdf+.

=== Forums

The Forums menu option opens the {product} support forums. More information is available in the xref:Peach_Forums[Peach Forums] section of the documentation.

=== Switching Pits

The active Peach Pit can be changed in the {peachweb} by clicking on the Pit name in the upper right of the window. 

If the Pit file was specified on the command line when starting Peach, it cannot be changed. You need to exit the {peachweb}, and re-launch Peach with the new Pit name to start fuzzing with the new Pit.
