=== Test Pit Configuration

In the Test section, Peach runs a test case on the selected Pit configuration *without any fuzzing*. At the end of the test, a Pass/Fail status is given to the configuration, as well as line item reports for the different parts of the configuration. 

You can access the Test screen from the following places:

* At the end of the Quick Start Wizard, after completing the automation section.
* From the Test menu entry of the Quick Start menu.
* From the Test menu entry of the Configuration menu.

NOTE: The test requires that the target device, service, or application be available for use. 

1. Click the Test menu item. +
The following screen displays. Note that the top section of the screen indicates whether the configuration is completed and ready for testing:

2. Click the Begin Test button to run the test. +

If a test fails, the detail items identify how the test failed. Peach provides any generated log output for review to remediate the configuration issue. The following illustration shows a failed test.

Timeouts occurred in two parts of the test. One thing to check in this configuration is the IP v4 addressses to ensure that a communication channel can be established.
