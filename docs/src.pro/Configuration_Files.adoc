== Configuration Files

Most Peach pits contain configurable information. For example a network Pit might store source and destination IP addresses for the network. Some configuration settings apply to a specific operating system. 

Peach uses configuration files that allow different settings based on operating system. The information stored in a configuration file is typically used many times in a single definition and rarely stays the same. The presence of a configuration file eases the burden of supplying configurable settings by hand, an awkward and error-prone task. 

You can create configuration files with default values and reuse them as needed. Peach configuration files use placeholders that are replaced at runtime either through a configuration file or via the command line. Peach automatically tries to load a configuration file along with the Pit file at the start of a fuzzing session. The naming convention of a Pit configuration file is +PIT.xml.config+, where +PIT.xml+ is the name of your fuzzing definition. 

[source,xml]

<PitDefines>
  <All>     <1>
    <Define key="TargetIPv4" value="127.0.0.2"/>
    <Define key="TargetPort" value=â€œ22"/>
  </All>
  <Linux>   <2>
    <Define key="Interface" value="eth0"/>
  </Linux>
  <OSX>     <3>
    <Define key="Interface" value="em0"/>
  </OSX>
</PitDefines>

<3> This section is only for OS X

Use of the defined key's is done by wrapping them in "##". So Interface becomes `##Interface##` as shown in the following example.

[source,xml]
----
<Monitor class="NetworkCapture">
  <Param name="Device" value="##Interface##"/>
</Monitor>

<Publisher class="Tcp" name="TcpHandler">
  <Param name="Host" value="##TargetIPv4##"/>
  <Param name="Port" value="##TargetPort##"/>
</Publisher>

Overriding one configuration file with a second (or another) configuration file requires using the +--config+ command-line argument. The values in file specified on the command line override the values listed in the default .config file.

----
Peach.exe --config=CommonConfig.xml MyPit.xml
----

You can specify individual configuration items (keys) on the command line by using the +-D+ argument. Values provided via the command line override those provided by file.

----
Peach.exe -DTargetIp=10.1.1.1 MyPit.xml

=== Internally-defined Keys

Peach includes several predefined configuration keys that can be used in your Pits.

Peach.Cwd:: Defined as the current working directory.

Peach.Pwd:: Defined as the directory containing the Peach executable.

//  * Basic usage
//  * More complex usage
//   * Config including config
//   * Overriding config value via command line
//  * When does replacement occur
//   * Tricks this allows (changing the XML, not just values)
