== Maximum Occurrence Attribute

_maxOccurs_ specifies the maximum number of times an element can occur.  

Peach will treat _maxOccurs_ as an array.

Occurrence attributes are used when cracking, producing, and mutating data; they define how often an element can occur. 

The occurrence attributes _maxOccurs_ and xref:minOccurs[minOccurs] can be combined to provide an element's occurrence range.  

Related attributes: xref:minOccurs[minOccurs], xref:occurs[occurs].

<!-- Can occur a maximum of two times -->
<Block name="OtherThings" maxOccurs="2">
  <String name="A" value="A" />
  <String name="B" value="B" />
  <String name="C" value="C" />
</Block>

<!-- Can occur a maximum of 1000 times -->
<String name="OptionalValue" maxOccurs="1000" />
