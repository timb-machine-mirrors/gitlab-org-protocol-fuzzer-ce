A PIT is NOT valid unless...

 * The first iteration is successful against the target
 * The target is isolated from other input. 
 * You can demonstrate the target has parsed your data by checking if:
 ** GUI opening the image data
 ** Network service logs your data 
 ** Correct response packet from the target for the packet you sent
 ** The status lights blink appropriately
 * Logging is enabled
 * Monitoring is enabled
 * Monitoring has been tested and fault on a demo/test fault 

=== What to do if the pit doesn't parse

----
Peach.exe -t pit_file.xml 
----

If a stack trace prints, record the stack trace where improper error handling is happening.
The pit doesn't run properly.
During the testing and building phase run the first iteration only. 

----
Peach.exe -1 pit_file.xml
----

Reduce the pit to basic parts in order make sure the 

. Test
.. References have the right names
. Log Path
.. Has a valid folder 
. Publisher
.. Can correctly talk to or output data
. Agent
.. Monitor setup is correct and had connectivity
. State Machine
.. References data and Models correctly
. DataModel

Add +--debug+ for more verbose output.

----
Peach.exe -1 --debug pit_file.xml
