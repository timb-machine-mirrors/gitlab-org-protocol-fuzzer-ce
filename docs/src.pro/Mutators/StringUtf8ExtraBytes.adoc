== StringUtf8ExtraBytes


// Encode single and multi-byte characters in more bytes than needed. 

This mutator produces test cases for UTF-8 String elements by generating new strings and then populating the strings with randomly-selected values. The interesting aspect of this mutator is that the storage allocated for each character is more than 1 byte: 2, 4, 6, or 8 bytes. The codes for these characters are included in the Unicode space and are unremarkable. 

The lengths of the generated strings form a distribution that centers on the current string length and ranges from 1 to 65K Unicode characters.


=== Supported Elements
