[[Mutators_SizedVarianceMutator]]
== SizedVarianceMutator ==

This mutator will change the length of the size of a data element to a range of size - N to size + N. By default, N = 50. In this case, the size indicator in the relation will update as the size of the data element changes. This means the actual size of the data and the size reported by the relation will be equal.

_Target Elements_

 * xref:DataModeling[DataElement] with a xref:Relation[SizeRelation]
* xref:Flag[Flag]
* xref:Number[Number] 
* xref:String[String]

_Hints_

 * SizedVarianceMutator-N -- Change the default +/- of 50 to a specified amount.

 _Notes_
* Only works on String if the value is numerical
* Variance mutators alter the size of the data to be fuzzed
* SizedVarianceMutator is similar to NumericVarianceMutator. It uses the same variance logic.
