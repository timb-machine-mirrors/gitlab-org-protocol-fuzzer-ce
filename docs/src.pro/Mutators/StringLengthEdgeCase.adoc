[[Mutators_StringLengthEdgeCase]]
== StringLengthEdgeCase

This mutator produces test cases for String elements. The test cases are length edge cases created by shrinking and growing the string as needed. The lengths are generated using a guassian distribution around numberical edge cases. Edge cases are defined as boundaries between signed/unsigned and bit boundaries (0, 8, 16, 32, 64).

The maximum sized string generated is 65K characters.

=== Supported Elements
