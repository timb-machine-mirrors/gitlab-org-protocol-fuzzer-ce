[[Mutators_SizedVariance]]
== SizedVariance

This mutator produces test cases elements that are part of a size relationship. This mutator is similar to the xref:Mutators_NumberVariance[NumberVariance] mutator, except it will cause the sized element to expand such that the relationship is still valid. The test cases are produced using a guassian distribution with the current default value as the cetner of the distribution.

Values chosen will never be larger than the maximum size the size provider can handle.

=== Supported Elements

Elements part of a size relationship.

=== Hints

This mutator does not support any hints.
