[[Mutators_BlobChangeFromNull]]
== BlobChangeFromNull

This mutator will produce test cases in which null bytes in a xref:Blob[Blob] element are changed to a non-null value. The mutator operates by picking a slice of bytes, between 1 and 100, to operate on. Each null byte is changed to a different randomly selected non-null value.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Blob[Blob]

=== Hints

BlobChangeFromNull-N:: Standard deviation of number of bytes to change.
BlobMutator-N:: Standard deviation of number of bytes to change. Will affect other Blob mutators.
