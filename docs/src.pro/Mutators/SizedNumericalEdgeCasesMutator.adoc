== SizedNumericalEdgeCasesMutator

This mutator will change the length of the size of a data element to a range around numerical edge cases. By default, this range is N - 50 to N + 50 around each edge case. In this case, the size indicator in the relation will update as the size of the data element changes. This means the actual size of the data and the size reported by the relation will be equal.

=== Supported Elements

* xref:DataModeling[DataElement] with a xref:Relation[SizeRelation]
* xref:Flag[Flag]
* xref:Number[Number] 
* xref:String[String]
  
=== Hints

SizedNumericalEdgeCasesMutator-N:: Change the default +/- of 50 to a specified amount.
