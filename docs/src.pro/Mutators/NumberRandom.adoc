[[Mutators_NumberRandom]]
== NumberRandom

This mutator produces test cases for Number and String elements. String elements are only supported when the default data they contain is an integer. The test cases produced are random integers in the numerical space of the element. For a signed 8 bit number that range is 0 to 255. For String elements, the range is that of a signed 64bit integer, –9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

For weighting purposes, and for deterministic strategies, this mutator reports that it can generate 5,000 test cases.
