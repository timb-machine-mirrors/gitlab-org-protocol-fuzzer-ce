== UnicodeBomMutator

Unicode BOMs (byte order markers) are non-displayed byte sequences. The Unicode encoder uses Unicode BOMs to determine the data's byte order (endianness). 

_UnicodeBomMutator_ injects BOMs into the same list of useful fuzzing strings that xref:Mutators_StringMutator[StringMutator] generates. 

Because Unicode BOMs do not display, they are not added to the Unicode strings' character length. A common security issue is to miscalculate buffer sizes with handling strings containing BOMs. This can lead to memory overruns.
