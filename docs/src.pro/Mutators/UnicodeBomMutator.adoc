== UnicodeBomMutator

Unicode BOMs (byte order markers) are non-displayed byte sequences that indicate the byte order (endianness) of the data to the Unicode encoder. This mutator injects BOMs into the same list of useful fuzzing strings that xref:Mutators_StringMutator[StringMutator] generates. 

Because these elements do not display, they are not added to the Unicode strings' character length. A common security issue is to miscalculate buffer sizes with handling strings containing BOMs. This can lead to memory overruns.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

This mutator does not support any hints.
