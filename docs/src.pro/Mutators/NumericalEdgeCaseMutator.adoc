== NumericalEdgeCaseMutator

This mutator will produce values in a range of N - 50 through N + 50 for all numerical edge cases.  For example 16-bit numbers have the following edge cases: 0, signed byte (127), unsigned byte (255), signed short, unsigned short.

.Numerical Strings
****
This mutator will work with xref:String[String] elements that contain a default value that is numerical. If a string element does not contain a numerical string, this mutator will not mutate it. However, the default fuzzing cases for strings do include interesting numbers.
****

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:Number[Number]
 * xref:Flag[Flag]
 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

NumericalEdgeCaseMutator-N:: Change the default +/- of 50 to a specified amount.
NumericalString:: Allows strings to be picked up and mutated by this mutator.
