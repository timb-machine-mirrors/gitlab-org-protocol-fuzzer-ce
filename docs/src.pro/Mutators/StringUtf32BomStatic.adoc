== StringUtf32BomStatic

The _StringUtf32BomStatic_ mutator produces test cases for Unicode UTF-32 strings by creating a mutated string in two ways:

* Create a string using the xref:StringStatic[StringStatic] mutator
* Inject 1 to 6 Unicode Byte Ordering Marks (BOMs) in arbitrary places in the string

BOMs are not considered characters, and injecting BOMs into a string that might be filtered could cause 
the filtering not to work and the string would be accepted.

BOM marks, whether for Big Endian-ness or for Little Endian-ness, are selected arbitrarily.
