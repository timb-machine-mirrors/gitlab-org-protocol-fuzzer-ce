[[Mutators_StringUnicodeNonCharacters]]
== StringUnicodeNonCharacters

This mutator produces test cases for String elements by selecting a random set of Unicode codepoints that do not map to actual characters. This mutator will only work with Strings that have a Unicode encoding type such as UTF8. The length of the String generated will be a distribution centered on the current length with an upper maximum of 65K (ushort max) and lower bounds of 1.

Certain noncharacter code points are guaranteed never to be used for encoding characters, although applications may make use of these code points internally if they wish. There are sixty-six noncharacters: U+FDD0..U+FDEF and any code point ending in the value FFFE or FFFF (i.e. U+FFFE, U+FFFF, U+1FFFE, U+1FFFF, ... U+10FFFE, U+10FFFF). The set of noncharacters is stable, and no new noncharacters will ever be defined.
