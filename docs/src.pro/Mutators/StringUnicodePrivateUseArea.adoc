== StringUnicodePrivateUseArea

This mutator produces test cases for String elements by selecting a random set of Unicode points between 0xE000 - 0xF8FF (private use area) characters. This mutator will only work with Strings that have a Unicode encoding type such as UTF8. The length of the String generated will be a distribution centered on the current length with an upper maximum of 65K (ushort max) and lower bounds of 1.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]
