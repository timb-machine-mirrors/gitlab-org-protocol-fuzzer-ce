== StringUtf8BomStatic

The _StringUtf8BomStatic_ mutator produces test cases for Ascii and Unicode UTF-8 strings by creating a mutated string in two ways:

* Creates a string using the xref:StringStatic[StringStatic] mutator
* Inject 1 to 6 Unicode Byte Ordering Marks (BOM code points) in arbitrary places in the sting

BOM code points are not considered characters, and injecting BOMs into a string that might be filtered could cause 
the filtering not to work and the string would be accepted.

NOTE: StringUtf8BomStatic does not run on data elements that specify the hint *Peach.TypeTransform=false*.

=== Supported Elements

 * xref:String[String]

=== Hints

None.
