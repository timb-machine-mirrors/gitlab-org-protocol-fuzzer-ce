=== Data Elements

The following items comprise the data elements in Peach.

xref:Blob[Blob]::
+
--
_Blobs_ are containers for unstructured data (think byte arrays).
A _Blob_ is a term used in the relational database field for a column that holds raw binary data.
Data contained in _Blobs_ will be dumb fuzzed.
--

xref:Block[Block]::
+
--
The _Block_ element is a container for other data elements. By themselves, _Blocks_ do not have any size or contain other data. They group other data elements so all the items in the group can be referenced or operated on as a single unit. 

For example, if two data elements are included in a checksum calculation, they can be placed in a  _Block_ element and then the fixup can perform its function by referencing the _Block_. Both items in the group will be included in the fixup operation.
--

xref:Choice[Choice]::
+
--
The _Choice_ element allows constructing switch-like statements in Peach data models. The _Choice_ element is useful when modeling type-length-value (TLV) metaphors and in other situations where the data format changes.
--

xref:DataModel[DataModel]::
+
--
The _DataModel_ element is a top-level element that defines a data model.
Multiple _DataModels_ can be defined in a pit file.
_DataModels_ by themselves have no size and should simply be considered containers for other data elements.
--

xref:Flags[Flags]::
+
--
_Flags_ defines a set of flags and is a container for _Flag_ elements. The _Flags_ container  can provide a nice shortcut when dealing with a flag set that has many unused positions. 

Tip: The _Number_ element supports unaligned sizes and can also be used to define flags.
--

xref:Flag[Flag]::
+
--
_Flag_ defines a specific _Flag_ in a flag set. _Flag_ elements have a bit position and bit length.
--

xref:Number[Number]::
+
--
_Number_ defines a binary integer type. _Numbers_ are always packed down to bit/byte representation with byte order (endian-ness). For ASCII strings, use the _String_ element instead of a _Number_.
--

xref:Padding[Padding]::
+
--
_Padding_ defines padding of one or more characters for a _Block_ or a _DataModel_. The attributes of the _Padding_ element specify things such as a reference to start the alignment calculation, a size, and the _Padding_ element name. The most common use of _Padding_ is to ensure a consistent length of a _Block_ or _DataModel_ that contains variable length data elements, such as padding a _DataModel_ for a 64-byte packet.
--

xref:Stream[Stream]::
+
--
_Stream_ defines a _Stream_ element with a name, attributes and content. _Streams_ group one or more data elements into a logical structure.
--

xref:String[String]::
+
--
A _string_ defines a contiguous sequence of characters with encoding. Encodings include ASCII and many Unicode formats.
--

xref:XmlAttribute[XmlAttribute]::
+
--
The _XmlAttribute_ defines an XML attribute. This element is only valid as a child of xref:XmlElement[XmlElement].
--

xref:XmlElement[XmlElement]::
+
--
_XmlElement_ defines an XML element.
