[[Logger]]
== Loggers

A logger will record the fuzzing run, including any faults run, and data collected by monitors. If a logger is not configured, this information will not be stored. {product} includes a file system logger. The logging system is extensible, allowing for custom loggers to be added by writing a plugin.

[[Loggers_File]]
=== File

The file system logger will log to a specified path.  A folder is created containing the run name and time stamp.  Inside of this folder are the actual logs.  Until a fault is detected very little information is logged to conserve disk space.
