[[Logger]]
== Loggers

A logger will record the fuzzing run (including any faults) and data collected by monitors. 

IMPORTANT: If a logger is not configured, this information will not be stored. 

{product} includes a file system logger. The logging system is extensible, allowing you to add custom loggers by writing  plug-ins.

[[Loggers_File]]
=== File

The file system logger will log to a specified path.  Peach creates a folder containing the run name and time stamp.  Inside of this folder are the actual logs.  Until a fault is detected very little information is logged to conserve disk space.
