=== OS X

To install on OS X, first install the latest stable Mono .NET runtime, then Peach. To enable support for the xref:Monitors_CrashWrangler[CrashWrangler] monitor, install CrashWrangler and Xcode. Note that installing CrashWrangler is optional; it is only needed when running the target locally.

1. Install the http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html[Mono packages].
+
Peach Fuzzer, LLC, recommends using Mono .NET runtime version 4 from the mono project. The mono project has apt packages for many Linux implementations.

2. Unzip the Peach distribution to an appropriate folder. +
The filename begins with "peach-pro" and lists the operating system in the name, such as "peach-pro-{BUILDTAG}-osx_release.zip". 

3. Install CrashWrangler. 
+
CrashWrangler *MUST* be compiled on each OS X machine. Peach includes the CrashWrangler source files in the peach distribution. Here are instructions to install and compile CrashWrangler from the peach zip.

.. Ensure XCode is installed.
.. Open Terminal.app.
.. Navigate to the folder where you extracted peach-pro-{BUILDTAG}-osx_release.zip.
.. Finish installing CrashWrangler using the following commands.
