File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another
host over a TCP-based network, such as the Internet.

FTP is built on a client-server architecture and uses separate control and data connections between the client
and the server. FTP users may authenticate themselves using a clear-text sign-in protocol, normally in the form
of a username and password, but can connect anonymously if the server is configured to allow it.
