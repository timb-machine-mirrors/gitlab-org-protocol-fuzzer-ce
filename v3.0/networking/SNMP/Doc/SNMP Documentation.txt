== SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol Client  

Pit Revision : 1.0 

The included Peach Pit file snmp_3_0.xml covers parts of the SNMP RFC specification 1901 SNMP v2c. Peach uses this pit to perform automated negative testing of the SNMP protocol.   

=== Compatibility 

This pit is compatible with

- Peach Fuzzer 3.0
- Peach Enterprise 3.0
- Peach Farm 1.0 

=== Defines 

The SNMP_Defines.xml file is used to configure the pit file for each environment and target. 

The following keys are used. 

*SnmpSrcPort* 

 Defines which source port the SNMP traffic will appear to originate from. 

[source,xml]
----
    <Define key="SnmpSrcPort" value="161"/>
----

*SnmpPort*	

 The port that the target SNMP server is listening on. Default is 161. 
 
[source,xml]
----	
    <Define key="SnmpPort"    value="161"/>
----
	
*SnmpHost* 
 The address the target SNMP server is listening on. Default is localhost. 	
	
[source,xml]
----
    <Define key="SnmpHost"    value="localhost"/>
----

*CommString*

    <Define key="CommString"  value="public"/>
----

*LoggerPath* 

The path to create the logs from the fuzzing test. 

[source,xml]
----
    <Define key="LoggerPath"  value="./logs/snmp/"/>
----

*Strategy* 

The type of fuzzing Peach will perform. Sequential and Random are valid. Default is Sequential.

=== Fuzzing Scenarios

This pit can be used to generate test client SNMP requests across a network or to a local system. 

 - Embedded devices
 - Network appliances
 - SNMP Servers 

=== Coverage 

This PIT is capable of intelligently fuzzing the following client protocol messages.

 * GetRequest - Get a MIB on a host system. 
 * GetNextRequest - Get the next MIB in the tree on the host system. 
 * GetBulkRequest - Get a set of bulk MIBs from the host system.
